__Balance Sheet__
Assets and Liabilities

## Chapter 1.2.1

__Balance Sheet Equation__
> Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' equity __资产 = 负债 + 所有者权益__
> 你所拥有的任何东西（资产）都必须有资金来源。你只有两种方式来筹集资金购买资产：
> 1. 向别人借钱 (Borrowing from others): 这就是负债 (Liabilities)。当你通过贷款买了一台机器，这台机器是资产，而你欠银行的钱就是负债。
> 2. 用自己的钱 (Using your own money): 这就是股东权益 (Equity)。包括股东投入的资本或企业赚取并留存的利润。

__Stockholders' Equity = Contributed Capital(投入资本) + Retained Earnings(留存收益)__
__Retained Earnings = Prior Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends__
__Net Income = Revenues - Expenses__
拆解的细分公式：
__Assets= Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Prior Retained Earnings + Revenues - Expenses - Dividends__
> 类似本金+%利率收益
> 举例：
> 你通过销售金属探测器赚取了 2,000∗∗的净利润，并且没有把这笔钱作为股利花掉，而是留在公司
> (Calculation): $12,000 (股东权益) = $10,000 (投入资本) + $2,000 (留存收益)

### Chapter 1.2.2
__Assets__
> It is acquired in a past transaction or exchange
> The value of its future benefits can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision

__Liabilities__
> The obligation义务 is based on benefits or services received currently or in the past
> The amount and timing of payment is reasonably certain

__Stockholders' Equity__
> also called "net worth", "net assets", "net book value"

## Chapter 1.3.1
__Three Fundamental Bookkeeping Equations__
1. Assets = Liabilitis + stockholders' Equity
2. Sum of Debits = Sum of Credits
3. Beginning account balance + increases - decreases = ending account balance

Debit = Left-side Entry
Credit = Right-side Entry

__Debits(Assets + Expenses) = Credits(Liabilities + Contrib Capital + Retained Earnings + Revenues)__

__Normal Balance__(该科目通常在借方还是贷方结余)
> The type of balance(debit or credit) the account carries under normal circumstances
> __Assets, Expenses is Debit__
> __Liabilities, Stockholders' Equity, Revenues is Credit__

__T Account__
> A record of all changes in an accounting quantity
> Debits on left side and Credits on right side

__Account Balance__
> Difference between sum of debits and sum of credits for the account
